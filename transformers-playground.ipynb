    "# Playing with transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is a rough draft!)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) is a Python library released by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) to make it easy to use pre-trained transformer language models. This notebook takes you through the basics of how to generate text with this library, and demonstrates a few simple techniques you can use to assert finer-grained control over the text generation procedure, like logit warping and fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, I recommend reading [On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) by Bender et al. The paper outlines the difficulties and potential for harm in large pre-trained language models, and suggests some techniques for training and making use of these models responsibly. For my part, I have the following recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't use pre-trained language models in an automated context. By \"automated context\" I mean things like web apps, Twitter bots, etc. You just can't guarantee that the output of one of these models won't be harmful. (I might make an exception to this rule if your automated service has *very* robust moderation, but even then, it's iffy.)\n",
    "* Always read through all of your language model outputs before publishing them.\n",
    "* Don't use language models to trick people.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a \"transformer\" though\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Transformer\" is a name applied to neural network architectures that make use of a mechanism called [\"attention\"](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) and can be trained in parallel (rather than sequentially, as is the case with other neural network architectures that are frequently used to model sequences, like recurrent neural networks). The [introduction of this architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) initiated a period of tremendous growth in language model capabilities. (Examples of Transformer models include [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) and [Google T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "This growth is mostly predicated on the fact that the transformer architecture makes it more practical to train language models on larger and larger datasets. As of this writing, state-of-the-art transformer models are often trained on datasets many hundreds of gigabytes in size, and consequently take a tremendous amount of energy (and money, and time) to train. In many cases, it's not practical to train a transformer model from scratch on your own that has the same capabilities. Instead, researchers and artists make use of models that other organizations have trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hugging Face Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where the Hugging Face Transformers library comes in. It's an easy interface for downloading pre-trained transformer models and making use of them with a consistent API. (For example, we can use the same code to generate text with GPT-2 and [XLNet](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/xlnet.html)). To install Transformers, you'll first need to install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). If you're running this notebook with Anaconda, you can just run the code in the following cell:"

    "Machine learning models don't work on text directly; instead, they operate on numbers that correspond to parts of a text. Breaking a text up into enumerable parts is called *tokenization*. In this class, we've already explored several easy and common forms of tokenization, e.g., breaking a text up into characters, or breaking a text up into words. Most machine learning models now use a form of *sub-word* tokenization, in which a text is broken up into units that don't neatly correspond to either individual characters or whole words. The tokenization procedure itself is derived from statistical properties of the corpus—so tokenizers are, in a sense, \"trained\" in the same way that a machine learning model is.

Subword tokenizers generally don't start off with information about where word boundaries occur; instead, they \"learn\" word boundaries as part of the process of \"training\" the tokenizer. The `Ġ` character is a special character that represents a space. Second, we can see that in many cases, the subword tokenizer does actually end up with tokens in its vocabulary that represent entire words. However, in other cases, we end up with what look like word *parts*. This is by design! Because some tokens represent word parts, the tokenizer can potentially encode *any* word—even words that were not present in the original corpus—by tokenizing that word as a sequence of parts.\n",
